Smart IoT Parking Lock with 4G and Bluetooth Compatibility
----------------------------------------------------------
Project Overview
This advanced parking lock solution is designed to streamline parking access and management with innovative IoT features, durable hardware, and remote control options. Built with reliable connectivity and ruggedized for outdoor environments, it provides users with convenience and flexibility through both a web interface and mobile app. This smart parking lock incorporates leading-edge features such as real-time position detection, robust motor control, and seamless over-the-air (OTA) updates, ensuring optimal performance and ease of maintenance.


Hardware Design
	- A custom-designed PCB integrates the Nordic nRF51820 Bluetooth-compatible CPU and the SIM7600 4G chipset, achieving compactness and optimal signal quality for wireless communication.
	- Designed for minimal power consumption to extend battery life while maintaining consistent performance, the PCB layout ensures efficient heat dissipation and signal integrity.
	- Core Components:
		* Microcontroller (Nordic nRF51820): A Bluetooth-enabled CPU, providing low-latency communication and control over local device functions. With ARM Cortex-M0 capabilities, it manages device functionality while balancing power and performance.
		* SIM7600 4G Module: Ensures stable and high-speed connectivity to cloud servers, enabling real-time remote control and data access.
		* Motor and Position Sensing Circuitry:
			Current-based position detection senses the arm's precise location, while the motor control circuit enables smooth, reliable arm movement with low noise and minimal wear.
			The circuit design includes a feedback loop to allow for quick error detection and correction, enhancing stability in variable conditions.
			


Firmware Features		
	Real-Time Operating System (RTOS):
		- The firmware is powered by an RTOS to enable effective multitasking, ensuring smooth coordination between 	connectivity, motor control, and OTA updates.
		- RTOS support allows for low-power operation modes, optimizing battery life during idle periods.
	Ultrasonic sensor driving integration:
		- Integrated ultrasonic sensors provide real-time detection of vehicle presence, ensuring accurate operational control. This feature prevents unauthorized access, allowing the lock to remain closed unless a vehicle is detected, and aids in efficient space management.
		- The ultrasonic detection code is optimized for quick responsiveness and minimal power draw, contributing to the device's operational efficiency.
